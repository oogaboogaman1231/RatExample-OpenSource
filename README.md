# Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the Remote Access Tool, you can refer to the following troubleshooting steps:

## 1. Compilation Errors
- **Issue:** If you encounter compilation errors when running `install.bat`, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and that your compiler path is correctly set.
- **Solution:** Double-check your compiler setup and ensure that all required libraries are properly linked.

## 2. Missing Dependencies
- **Issue:** If the application fails to run due to missing dependencies, such as `ws2_32.lib` or `Comctl32.lib`, make sure these libraries are included in your project and properly linked during compilation.
- **Solution:** Verify that the necessary libraries are present in your project and correctly configured in your compiler settings.

## 3. Desktop Shortcut Not Created
- **Issue:** If the desktop shortcut is not created after running `install.bat`, check if the script encountered any errors during execution.
- **Solution:** Review the output of the `install.bat` script for any error messages. Ensure that the script has sufficient permissions to create shortcuts on the desktop.

## 4. GUI Not Displayed
- **Issue:** If the GUI fails to display after running the server, check if there are any issues with the graphical interface libraries or system configurations.
- **Solution:** Verify that your system meets the requirements for running the Remote Access Tool and ensure that all necessary dependencies are properly installed.
