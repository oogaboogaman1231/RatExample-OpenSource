# Remote Access Tool V1.2.0A ðŸš¨SECUREðŸš¨

## Overview
This project is a remote access tool that allows you to control a remote computer. It supports various features such as remote desktop viewing, password recovery, and supports dynamic DNS services like ngrok and No-IP.

## Features
- Remote Desktop (Live screen footage)
- Password Recovery (Retrieve stored passwords)
- TCP and UDP server support
- Dynamic DNS support with ngrok and No-IP
- Customizable build options for the agent
- Options to start on startup, hide in specific directories, and use mutexes
- Secure communication using OpenSSL for encryption

## Requirements
- Windows operating system
- Visual Studio or any compatible C++ development environment
- [Msftedit.dll](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/richedit/) for RichEdit control (part of Windows OS)
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) for secure communication

## Installation
- First [download the installer](installer.bat), then run it
- Wait for it to do its thing

## Updating
- We recommend for the user to always keep the installer file since it will download and install the most recent version of the RAT when executed.

## Running the Application
- After running the install.bat script, a shortcut named "RAT Server" will be created on your desktop. You can use this shortcut to run the server.

## Ngrok Setup
- Sign up for an ngrok account and get your auth token.
- Enter your ngrok auth token in the respective field in the GUI.

## No-IP Setup
- Sign up for a No-IP account.
- Create a hostname and get your No-IP credentials.
- Enter your No-IP username, password, and hostname in the respective fields in the GUI.

## Usage

### Configure the Server
1. **Enter Server IP and Port:**
   - In the GUI, enter the IP address and port number for the server.
2. **Start the Server:**
   - Click the button to start the TCP server.

### Build and Deploy the Agent
1. **Enter Agent IP, Port, and Password:**
   - In the GUI, enter the IP address, port number, and password for the agent.
2. **Generate RSA Keys for Secure Communication:**
   - Use OpenSSL to generate RSA keys:
     ```sh
     openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
     openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
     ```
   - Ensure `private.pem` is kept secure and `public.pem` is distributed with the agent.
3. **Build the Agent:**
   - Click the button to build the agent. The build process will include the public key for encryption.

### Deploying the Agent
- Deploy the generated agent executable to the target machine.
- Ensure the agent has access to `public.pem` for encryption.

### Controlling the Agent
- Use the server GUI to control the agent, view the remote desktop, and recover passwords.
- All communication between the server and agent will be encrypted using the provided keys.

## Changelog
- **V1.2.0A:** Added support for secure communication using OpenSSL encryption.
- **V1.1.2A:** Fixed various bugs and improved stability.
- **V1.1.0A:** Added dynamic DNS support with ngrok and No-IP.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the Remote Access Tool, you can refer to the following troubleshooting steps:

### 1. Compilation Errors
- **Issue:** If you encounter compilation errors when running `install.bat`, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and that your compiler path is correctly set.
- **Solution:** Double-check your compiler setup and ensure that all required libraries are properly linked.

### 2. Missing Dependencies
- **Issue:** If the application fails to run due to missing dependencies, such as `ws2_32.lib` or `Comctl32.lib`, make sure these libraries are included in your project and properly linked during compilation.
- **Solution:** Verify that the necessary libraries are present in your project and correctly configured in your compiler settings.

### 3. Desktop Shortcut Not Created
- **Issue:** If the desktop shortcut is not created after running `install.bat`, check if the script encountered any errors during execution.
- **Solution:** Review the output of the `install.bat` script for any error messages. Ensure that the script has sufficient permissions to create shortcuts on the desktop.

### 4. GUI Not Displayed
- **Issue:** If the GUI fails to display after running the server, check if there are any issues with the graphical interface libraries or system configurations.
- **Solution:** Verify that your system meets the requirements for running the Remote Access Tool and ensure that all necessary dependencies are properly installed.
